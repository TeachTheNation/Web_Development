# Text Formatting

HTML has several text definition and formatting elements. 
These focus on stylistic choices, such as italic and bold.

These HTML text elements were designed to display special types of text:
* **\<b>** - Bold text
* **\<strong>** - Important text
* **\<i>** - Italic text
* **\<u>** - Underline

## Bold and Strong

The **\<b>** element lets us define text to be bold without any extra importance.

```html
<b>This text is bold</b>
```

The **\<strong>** element lets us define text to be bold with extra importance.
```html
<strong>This text is bold and important!</strong>
```

Generally, browsers will format **\<strong>** as **\<b>** - the two are more or less functionally interchangeable.

However, it is good practice to use **\<strong>** over **\<b>** as 'strong' semantically makes more sense than the letter 'b'.

## Italic

The **\<i>** element defines a part of text in "an alternate voice or mood". 
The content inside is typically displayed in italics. 

The **\<i>** tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, etc.
```html
<i>This text is italic</i>
```

## Underline

The **\<u>** element defines underlined text:
```html
<u>This is a one-line whip!</u>
```
