# Hypertext Markup Language

**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. 
Specifically, HTML is used to determine the general structure of, and actual contents stored within, a Web page.

## Introducing HTML

HTML is most commonly used alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript in Web pages.

If HTML determines the structure and content of a page, then CSS determines how the page looks to the user, while JavaScript determines what the page does.

As an analogy, if a web page is like a building...
* The CSS is the architecture style - how the building looks
* The JavaScript is its purpose - what the building is used for
* The HTML is the bricks, mortar, foundations, and every item stored in the building

* The latest version of HTML - HTML5 - includes a lot of changes to its previous version, which starts to blur the lines somewhat between JavaScript and HTML when it comes to basic functionality - HTML5, for instance, is capable of playing video without JavaScript to help it.

You can tell if a Web page is written in HTML5 by checking if the following declarative tag is written on line 1:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
