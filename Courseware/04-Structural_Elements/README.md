# Structural Elements

HTML5 has a series of **structural elements** which allow for Web developers to create semantically structured pages.

These **semantic elements** and **non-semantic elements** allow for easy separation of content.

## Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements

A **semantic element** clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. 
These include:

* \<header>
* \<nav>
* \<section>
* \<main>
* \<article>
* \<aside>
* \<footer>
* \<form>
* \<table>

There are also **non-semantic elements**, which are designed purely to inform the browser of content-separation:

* \<div>
* \<span>

These do not have any bearing on the content of the Web page itself.

### \<div>

The **\<div>** tag defines a division within an HTML document. 
It is used as a container for HTML elements, which can then be styled with CSS, or manipulated with JavaScript.

The **\<div>** tag is easily styled by using the **class** or **id** attributes. 
Any sort of content can be put inside the **\<div>** tag!

```html
<!Doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <style>
        .myDiv{background-color:red;}
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="myDiv">
        <p>This is some text in a paragraph</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**(note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the \<div> element)**

Most browsers will display **\<div>** element with the following default CSS values:
```css
div {
    display:block;
}
```

## Using Semantic Elements

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is the structure of a Web document, generated by the documentâ€™s headings, form titles, table titles, and any other appropriate landmarks.

The user can apply this information to generate a table of contents, for example.

This table of contents could then be used by assistive technology to help the user, or be parsed by a machine like a search engine to improve search results.

The sectioning elements **\<section>, \<article>, \<aside>** and **\<nav>** can all help to create a more logical structure in the DOM.

### \<header>

The **\<header>** element is normally the first element of the document, and generally acts as a container for hyperlinked images or text.

Headers contain levels from **\<h1>** (highest level, largest font size) to **\<h6>** (lowest level, smallest font size).

**(note: there can be one \<header> per sectioning block.)**

```html
<header>
  <a href="/">
    <img src="logo.png" alt="QA Home">
  </a>
  <h1>My Main Title</h1>
  <h2>My Sub title></h2>
</header>
```

### \<nav>

The **\<nav>** tag is used to mark up internal navigation on a Web page, as opposed to linking to external sites.

However, not all groups of links on a page need to be in a **\<nav>** element; it is primarily intended for sections that consist of major navigation blocks.

It is common for the **\<footer>** to contain a list of links to various pages of a Web site (e.g. Terms Of Service, Home Page, Contact).

The **\<footer>** element alone is sufficient for such cases; while a **\nav>** element can be used in such cases, it is usually unnecessary.

**\<nav>** elements can be nested inside other sectioning elements (most commonly the **\<header>** and **\<footer>**) and are typically surrounded by a **\<li>** within a **\<ul>**.

As such, multiple **\<nav>** are allowed, but each should contain a related category of links.

```html
<nav>
  <h2>Main site navigation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/about-us.html">About Us</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### \<main>

The **\<main>** tag specifies the main content of a document.

The content inside the **\<main>** element should be unique to the document. 
It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents, such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Some articles</h1>
  <article>
      <p>First Article Text</p>
  </article>
  <article>
      <p>Second Article Text</p>
  </article>
  <article>
      <p>Third Article Text</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

**(note: there must only be one \<main> element in a document, and it must not be a descendant of an \<article>, \<aside>, \<footer>, \<header>, or \<nav> element.)**

### \<footer>

The **\<footer>** element represents a footer for a document or a **\<section>** - generally, it is used at the bottom of a Web page, rather than a specific section, though they do see infrequent use. 
As such, many **\<footer>** elements can appear in a Web page.

They can also contain entire **\<sections>**, usually in the form of appendices, indices, sitemaps, and other less noteworthy Web page content.

Traditionally, the **\<footer>** should contain **\<small>** elements:
```html
<footer>
  <small>
    Small footer
  </small>
</footer>
```

A more unconventional use of the **\<footer>** element is a fat footer, which might contain images, external links, feedback or review boxes, advertising, etc.:
```html
<footer>
  <p>Fat footer</p>
</footer>
```
